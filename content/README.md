# Health Economics Metrics

A comprehensive introduction to health economics math, examples, and reasoning, written for software engineers building for national health service organizations worldwide. Each file covers one metric or concept: definition, why it matters, the math, a worked example, the software engineering connection, pitfalls, and sources.

New here? Start with [opportunity cost](topics/opportunity-cost.md), [quality-adjusted life year](topics/quality-adjusted-life-year.md), and [cost of delay](topics/cost-of-delay.md) — the three ideas everything else builds on.

## Economic reasoning foundations

- [Opportunity cost](topics/opportunity-cost.md) — the value of the best alternative forgone; why fixed budgets make every choice a displacement
- [Discounting and time preference](topics/discounting-and-time-preference.md) — present values, the 3.5% Green Book/NICE rate
- [Analysis perspective](topics/analysis-perspective.md) — payer vs provider vs societal: whose costs count
- [Time horizon](topics/time-horizon.md) — how long to count costs and effects, and horizon gaming
- [Marginal vs average cost](topics/marginal-vs-average-cost.md) — why freeing a bed doesn't save its average cost
- [Cash-releasing vs non-cash-releasing savings](topics/cash-releasing-vs-non-cash-releasing.md) — the honesty test for every "time saved" claim
- [Sensitivity analysis](topics/sensitivity-analysis.md) — tornado diagrams; which assumption carries your case
- [Probabilistic sensitivity analysis](topics/probabilistic-sensitivity-analysis.md) — Monte Carlo, CEACs, probability of being right
- [Expected value of perfect information](topics/expected-value-of-perfect-information.md) — pricing the pilot before you run it
- [Dominance and the efficiency frontier](topics/dominance-and-efficiency-frontier.md) — eliminating options nobody should pick

## Outcome measures

## Benchmark freshness

Many quoted figures refresh annually (NHS unit costs, payment scheme prices, DORA clusters, DiGA counts, LLM prices). Each doc dates its benchmarks in-line; re-verify before using in a live business case.

## Claude skills

This repo ships two [Claude Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) — drop either into a project's `.claude/skills/` (or point Claude at this repo's `skills/`) to put this book to work directly inside an agentic coding session:

- [health-economics-metrics-skill](https://github.com/health-economics-metrics/health-economics-metrics/blob/main/skills/health-economics-metrics-skill/SKILL.md) — for general use: explain a concept, compute a metric from your own numbers, or assemble a multi-metric business case, grounded in this book's formulas, worked examples, and pitfalls rather than generic recall.
- [health-economics-metrics-maintainer-skill](https://github.com/health-economics-metrics/health-economics-metrics/blob/main/skills/health-economics-metrics-maintainer-skill/SKILL.md) — for maintainers of this repo: the per-topic template, README indexing conventions, and a link/sync validation checklist for adding or editing topics.
